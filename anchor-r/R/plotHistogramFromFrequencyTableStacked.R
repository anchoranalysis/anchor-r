  #   freqTable: data.frame or matrix. assumes first column are values, second column are counts, third column are factors to be stacked.
  #   maxHistBin: if -1, it is ignored, otherwise it is the value of the maximum-intensity-bin in the histogram
  #   minHistBin: It is the value of the minimum-intensity-bin in the histogram, defaulting to 0
  #   name: a name for the histogram
  #   xAxisLabel: a label for the xaxis
  #   extraFun: an extra-function that is plotted on top of the histogram
  #
  # Returns:
  #   the plot object from ggplot2
