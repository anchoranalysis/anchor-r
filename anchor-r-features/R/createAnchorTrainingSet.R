# Creates AnchorTrainingSet, a form needed for other training functions

# Args:
#   features: all feature-values including ids etc.
#   rebalance: if TRUE, the smaller class is upsampled to be as large as the bigger class
#   label: labels associated with the features
#   featuresTraining: a subset of feature-values that will be used for training
#   cutoffCorrelation: threshold above which features will be removed if sufficiently correlated with others
#
# Returns (after maybe rebalancing):
#  list(
#    featuresTraining    feature-values for training
#    label               labelling of the feature-values 1 or 0
#    features            all-features,
#    featuresLabel       cbind(features,label)
#    minSizeTrainingSet   minimum number of rows needed in training set
#    pp: preprocessing routine for data (to include center and scale). if NULL it is calculated from the training data
#    rebalance: if TRUE, over-samples the minority class to each parity
